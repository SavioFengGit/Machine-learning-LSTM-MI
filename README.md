Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are often used by malware to generate domains used to connect to command and control servers. Recent work in DGA discovery has leveraged deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and character-level short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to classify domains. <br>
The project is based on testing different machine algorithms learning for the detection of malicious domain names, adapting them to the assigned dataset and then carrying out a binary classification, thus comparing the various results obtained (metrics) of the different algorithms. In particular, the following algorithms will be tested: LSTM, Masked N-Grams, Bilbo and ELMo. <br>
The files related to the LSTM-MI algorithm are found in the following repository.
